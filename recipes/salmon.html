    <h3>Description</h2>
        <div style="max-width: 400px;">
            <p > Making a delicious salmon is a delightful experience that brings together a symphony of 
                flavors and textures. Start with a fresh, soft salmon bun and layer it with a juicy and 
                well-seasoned beef patty, cooked to perfection on the grill. Add a slice of melting cheese, 
                such as cheddar or Swiss, to elevate the taste. Next, pile on your favorite toppings like crisp
                lettuce, ripe tomato slices, and tangy pickles for a refreshing crunch. Don't forget the
                caramelized onions and sautéed mushrooms for an extra burst of flavor. Finally, drizzle
                your favorite sauce, whether it's classic ketchup, tangy BBQ, or creamy mayo, to tie all 
                the elements together. With the first bite, the savory, mouthwatering goodness of a homemade
                salmon is sure to satisfy your cravings and leave you craving more.
