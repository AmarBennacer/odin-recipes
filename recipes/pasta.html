    <h3>Description</h2>
        <div style="max-width: 400px;">
            <p> Creating a delightful pasta dish is a flavorful journey that
                 starts with boiling al dente pasta of your choice, be it spaghetti, 
                 penne, or linguine. While the pasta cooks, prepare a luscious sauce 
                 by sautéing garlic and onions in olive oil until fragrant, then adding
                  crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, and a pinch of red pepper flakes for a
                   delightful kick. Allow the sauce to simmer, letting the aromas meld
                    together beautifully. Once the pasta is ready, drain it and toss 
                     into the sauce, ensuring every strand is coated in its richness. For 
                     the finishing touch, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top, and if 
                     you desire, garnish with fresh basil leaves. The result is a mouthwatering
                      pasta dish that tantalizes the taste buds with its harmonious blend of 
                      flavors, perfect for a satisfying meal any day of the week.
